# katolikdunyasi.com

A static Catholic resource site in Turkish and English: every page is written in Turkish, and a TR | EN switch that stays on screen turns the whole page, its text and its buttons, into English in place (Latin originals are shown on request). It includes a full translation of the **Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church** (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2005; all 598 questions and answers, the Motu Proprio, the Introduction, both Creeds, the Decalogue table, the Our Father, and the full Appendix), plus original Turkish sections making the case for the Catholic faith, the OCIA/RCIA process for becoming Catholic, how Confession works, the Mass explained step by step, the parables of Jesus explained plainly, the Rosary and common prayers, a calendar of the saints, a guide to the Bible in Turkish, well-known Catholic miracles, Christianity's roots in Anatolia, frequently asked questions, and a directory of active Catholic churches in Turkey.

The site uses plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It loads no libraries and makes no CDN requests (the one exception is Cloudflare Turnstile, the spam check, loaded only on the contact page); the EB Garamond font (and Lexend, used only when a visitor turns on the dyslexia-friendly font) is self-hosted in `assets/fonts/`. You can open `index.html` straight from disk, or upload the folder to any static host.

Apart from the contact form, the site makes no outside network calls, and it never asks for the visitor's location. On a computer the header carries five dropdown menus (Öğren, Tartış, Dua Et, Keşfet, built by `Desk-Nav` in `tools/build.ps1`, and İletişim / Contact, built by `Dn-Contact`: the contact page, then the pages about the site under "Site Hakkında"); below 980px they fold into the full-menu overlay opened from the hamburger icon, which shows the day's liturgical season with a disc in the colour the priest wears (green, violet, white, red or rose), worked out in the browser from the date alone by `assets/script.js`'s `liturgicalDay()`, alongside the day's Rosary mystery and saint.

## Two languages: the TR | EN switch

**The live site is Turkish.** Since October 2026 only the Katekizm pages (`katekizm`, `giris`, `motu-proprio`, the four parts and `ekler`) keep their English and their `en/` twins; every other page is built in Turkish alone (`Strip-En` in `tools/build.ps1` takes the English out of the finished page), with no TR | EN switch, no `hreflang` and no `en/` twin. Nothing English was deleted: the English text stays in `data/` and `content/`, and `pwsh tools/build.ps1 -WithEnglish` builds the whole bilingual site described below (for another site).

The bilingual build (`-WithEnglish`): there is no separate English site. Each page carries both languages, and the TR | EN pill in the bottom corner (bottom left on the Katekizm's phone pages, where its button sits on the right) switches between them without reloading or losing the reader's place:

- In the build, `T` (a phrase), `TB` (a block), `TS` (SVG text) and `TA` (an attribute) in `tools/build.ps1` write a Turkish and an English version side by side: `<span class="l-tr">…</span><span class="l-en" lang="en">…</span>`, or `aria-label="…" data-en-aria-label="…"` for an attribute. `TO` marks something shown only in Turkish (the small English glosses under Turkish titles). CSS shows one language and hides the other (`html.lang-en`); the wrappers are `display: contents`, so they don't change the layout.
- Every page has two addresses: the Turkish one at the site root and an English twin under `en/` (`en/mass.html`, `en/church/<id>.html`; the names are in `$EnAltMap` in `tools/build.ps1`). The twin is the same page with an English `<html lang>`, title, description, canonical and structured data, so search engines index both languages; `hreflang` links and `sitemap.xml` pair them. The TR | EN switch is a pair of links between the two.
- A visitor who opens the Turkish home page but prefers English (their earlier choice, stored as `kd-lang-choice` in localStorage, or else a browser and time zone outside Turkey) is sent to the English home page by `<head>` before the page is drawn. Deeper Turkish pages are never redirected (someone arriving there came from a Turkish link or search result, and a redirect would cost them a second page load); search engines and other bots are never redirected either.
- The theme follows the sun: light from sunrise to sunset at the visitor's place, dark after. The place comes from the device's time zone only (a table in `script.js`, or the zone's offset); today's times are kept in `kd-sun` so `<head>` can pick the theme before the first paint. The theme switch overrides the sun until the next sunrise or sunset (`kd-theme-choice`).
- Text the scripts write (the calendar, search results, the phone's app screens, the rosary) is paired the same way: `LT(tr, en)` for HTML, and "pair strings" (`pmake`, `pstr`, `pset` and friends in `assets/script.js`) for labels taken from the page.
- Switching keeps the paragraph under the reading line in place, so a reader can flip back and forth in the middle of a long text.
- Content in `data/` has its English beside the Turkish: `en`/`textEn`/`bodyEn`/`historyEn` and so on (each file's header says which), and `content/<name>-en.md` for the Markdown pages.

`sitemap.xml` gives each page a `<lastmod>`: the date its data file last changed in git (the deploy fetches the full history for this). After the build, the deploy checks every page's HTML with html-validate (`.htmlvalidate.json`) and stops before publishing if the markup is broken.

Search engines and AI assistants are all welcome (`robots.txt` allows every crawler). `llms.txt` lists every page with its one-line description for AI assistants, and after each deploy the workflow tells the IndexNow search engines (Bing, Yandex and others) that the pages changed.

Search works on every page: it loads the four data files the first time someone uses it, then searches the Turkish and English text, or jumps straight to a question number. `index.html?q=...` opens the home page with a search already filled in.

## Illustrated sections

Most guide pages (Topraklarımızda Hristiyanlık, Günah Çıkarma, Neden Katoliğiz?, Kutsal Ayin, Katolik Olma Süreci, Mucizeler, Meseller, Sorular, Kutsal Kitap) are built from `Ill-Sec` in `tools/build.ps1`: a section with a line drawing beside it, a small "kicker" line over a large heading, and a colour tone (`gold`, `red`, `blue`, `green`, `purple`). The drawings are plain SVG strokes on a 120 × 120 grid in the `$Ill` table; each one draws itself as its section scrolls into view (`initDrawings` in `assets/script.js`) and appears whole without JavaScript or with "reduce motion" on. They are `aria-hidden`, purely decorative. To add one, add a set of `<path>` strokes to `$Ill` and name it in the page's `Ill-Sec` call. On a computer the drawing sits in a sticky column on the left; on phones it floats beside the heading.

## The contact form

`iletisim.html` has a form instead of an email address. It posts to `/api/contact`, which a Cloudflare Worker (`cloudflare/contact-worker.js`) answers: it checks a hidden trap field and Cloudflare Turnstile, then emails the message to the owner through Cloudflare Email Routing with the sender as Reply-To. The owner's address lives only in the Worker's secrets. The Turnstile site key (public) is `$TurnstileSiteKey` in `tools/build.ps1`; the İletişim page's Content Security Policy alone allows `challenges.cloudflare.com`. Setup and maintenance are in `cloudflare/README.md`.

## Editing content

1. Edit the text in `data/compendium-N.js` or `data/extras.js`. The format is described at the top of each file. A Q&A entry looks like this:
   ```js
   { "type": "qa", "n": 16, "id": "soru-16", "ccc": "85–90, 100",
     "tr": { "q": "…", "a": "… [[Petrus'un|Peter]] ardılı …" },
     "en": { "q": "…", "a": "…" } }
   ```
   - `[[Türkçe|English]]` marks a name that is spelled differently in Turkish. It is displayed as "Petrus'un (Peter)".
   - In an answer, `\n` starts a new paragraph, and a line that starts with `- ` becomes a bullet point.
   - Keep the text between the `/*JSON-START*/` and `/*JSON-END*/` markers as strict JSON: use double quotes and no trailing commas.
2. Rebuild the static pages:
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\build.ps1
   ```
   On macOS or Linux, run `pwsh tools/build.ps1` instead. The build takes about one second. On GitHub this happens automatically on every push (see below).

Search reads the data files at runtime, so edits show up in search results immediately. The pages themselves are pre-rendered for search engines, so they need the build.

**Domain:** the build reads your domain from the `CNAME` file (one line, e.g. `ornekalan.com`) and uses `https://<that domain>` for canonical, Open Graph and sitemap URLs. The file currently holds the placeholder `alanadiniz.com`, so the build prints a warning and falls back to `https://www.example.com` until you replace it.

## Phones: pages as app screens

Below 980px wide, every page except the home screen is shown as a screen of an app (`initAppView` in `assets/script.js`): the page's sections as a list, a section with its items as a list, an item on its own. All of the page's text stays in its HTML, so search engines read the same page on a phone as on a computer. Each level has its own `#anchor` address, so the browser's back steps back a level and links open the right level. The bar at the top leads back to the page's home screen app (Öğren, Dua Et, Keşfet, Tartış) or the page it belongs to (`Av-Parent` in `tools/build.ps1`); where a level holds Latin originals, a Türkçe / Latina switch swaps the text in place. Which elements are levels on each page is set in `AV_PAGES` in `assets/script.js`.

An X beside the settings gear returns to the home screen, where the four app icons are. The home screen's bar is drawn after the App Store's: a glyph and a name for each app, the open one in a capsule; tapping another app switches to it at once. The type, on every screen size, is Apple's own San Francisco where the device has it and Inter (`assets/fonts`, SIL Open Font License) elsewhere. Resizing a window across the phone width (980px) reloads an inner page in the other layout. Further into a page, its small icon and name lead straight back to the page's first screen (going back in the browser's history as many steps as that takes), with the levels in between shown under them. On the Katekizm's own pages a magnifier in the bar opens the question search across it.

## References and addresses

Every Scripture reference in a page's text (Turkish or English book names, e.g. "Matta 13:1–23", "1. Korintliler 12:13", "Luke 15:3–7") is linked at build time to that passage on BibleGateway in the RSV Catholic Edition (`Link-Refs` in `tools/build.ps1`); the English of the parables, which is the Douay-Rheims text, links to the same passage in that translation. Catechism paragraph references (the "KKK/CCC" numbers under the questions and in the text) open the Catechism on vatican.va in a new window: `data/ccc-vatican.json`, when present, maps paragraph ranges to the vatican.va page holding them, and a paragraph it doesn't cover opens the Catechism's contents page there.

The Katekizm overview is `katekizm.html`; its old address `katesizm.html` is a forwarding page that keeps any `?q=` search and `#question`.

## Editing the sources and copyright text

Edit `content/hakkinda.md`. On github.com, open the file, click the pencil icon and commit. The workflow rebuilds every page in about a minute, since the text appears in each page's footer. In the top block (between the `---` lines), `title` is the footer link and dialog heading, and `about` is the one-line sentence under the site name in the footer. The rest is Markdown, shown in the "Kaynaklar ve Telif" dialog:

| Write | Result |
|---|---|
| `## Heading` / `### Smaller heading` | section headings |
| blank line between lines | new paragraph |
| `**bold**`, `*italic*` | **bold**, *italic* |
| `[link text](https://…)` | link |
| `- item` or `1. item` | bullet / numbered list |
| `> text` | highlighted quote |
| `---` | divider line |

Raw HTML is shown as plain text, so the page can't be broken by accident.

## Publishing on GitHub Pages with your Cloudflare domain

**1. Put the files in the repository.** The *contents* of this folder go at the root of the repository, so `index.html` is at the top level. Include the hidden files (`.github/`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.htmlvalidate.json`). The branch must be called `main`.
- With GitHub Desktop or git: add everything, commit, push.
- In the browser: repository → **Add file → Upload files**, drag in everything *inside* this folder (not the folder itself), then commit.

**2. Turn on Pages (one time).** Repository → **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: "GitHub Actions"**. Pushing now runs the workflow; watch it under the **Actions** tab (a green tick means it's live).

**3. Set your domain.**
- Put your domain in `CNAME` (e.g. `ornekalan.com` or `www.ornekalan.com`) and commit.
- Settings → Pages → **Custom domain**: enter the same domain → Save. (With Actions deployments, this setting, not the CNAME file, is what GitHub uses for serving; the file feeds the build.)

**4. Cloudflare DNS** (Cloudflare → your domain → DNS → Records). Keep your existing GitHub verification TXT record.
- Apex domain (`ornekalan.com`): four **A** records for `@`: `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`. Optional **AAAA** records for `@`: `2606:50c0:8000::153`, `2606:50c0:8001::153`, `2606:50c0:8002::153`, `2606:50c0:8003::153`.
- `www`: a **CNAME** record `www` → `<your-github-username>.github.io`. GitHub then redirects between www and the apex automatically.
- Set these records to **DNS only** (grey cloud) at first, so GitHub can issue its HTTPS certificate.

**5. HTTPS.** Once Settings → Pages shows the DNS check passed and the certificate is ready (minutes to a few hours), tick **Enforce HTTPS**. After that you may switch the Cloudflare records to **Proxied** (orange cloud) if you want Cloudflare's CDN. If you do, set Cloudflare **SSL/TLS mode to "Full (strict)"**. Never use "Flexible", which causes a redirect loop.

**6. Cloudflare caching (current setup).** The records are **Proxied**, with SSL/TLS **Full (strict)**, **Always Use HTTPS** and **HSTS** (6 months, no preload). Two Cache Rules keep the files that rarely change at Cloudflare's edge; pages themselves are not cached, so a deploy shows up at once:
- `/assets/*` (CSS, JS, fonts, images): Edge TTL and Browser TTL 1 year. Safe because every CSS/JS link carries a content hash (`?v=…`); if you replace a font or an image under the same name, purge that URL (Caching → Configuration → Purge Cache).
- `/data/*` (the Catechism text and the verse popups the scripts fetch): Edge TTL and Browser TTL 2 hours, so data edits are visible within a couple of hours.
- Keep **Block AI bots** and Cloudflare's **managed robots.txt** off (the site's own `robots.txt` and `llms.txt` invite crawlers), and leave **Rocket Loader** off. If GitHub's Pages settings ever show a certificate warning, switch the records to DNS only for an hour, then back.

**Updating later:** edit `data/*.js`, `content/hakkinda.md` or the assets, then commit. The workflow rebuilds and republishes. The pages, `sitemap.xml` and the minified CSS/JS are not kept in the repository (see `.gitignore`): the workflow builds them on every push, so you only run `tools/build.ps1` yourself to preview locally.

## Translation conventions

- **Terminology** follows Turkish Catholic usage: Kutsal Sır (sacrament), Efkaristiya, Konfirmasyon, Tövbe ve Barışma, Kutsal Üçlü, Havari, Öğretim Makamı (Magisterium), Araf, Kutsal Ayin (Missa), and so on.
- **Names:** when a name is spelled differently in Turkish, the first mention in each card shows the Turkish form followed by the English in parentheses, e.g. Petrus (Peter), Aziz Augustinus (Saint Augustine), İznik (Nicaea), Kadıköy (Kalkedon) (Chalcedon). İsa (Jesus) and Meryem (Mary) appear on almost every card, so they are not glossed each time. The footer explains this.
- **Scripture:** citations keep the Catholic canon and the verse numbering of the Vatican source. That includes the Deuterocanonical books (e.g. 2 Makabeler 7:28, Bilgelik, Sirak) and the Catholic Psalm verse numbering (e.g. Mezmurlar 51:19). Book names are in Turkish.
- **Source corrections:** a few errors in the Vatican page were fixed, and each fix is marked:
  - Q420: "Galatians 1:25" becomes James 1:25. There is an editor's note on the card.
  - Q39: the CCC reference "2112–213" becomes 212–213.
  - Introduction footnote: "Laetarum magnopere" becomes *Laetamur magnopere*.
- **Q469 (death penalty):** the card translates the 2005 text faithfully and adds an editor's note about Pope Francis' 2018 revision of CCC 2267.

## Notes before publishing

- This is an **unofficial translation**. The original text is © Libreria Editrice Vaticana, and publishing a translation publicly normally requires LEV's permission. You may also want a Turkish Catholic reviewer (for example, someone connected to the Episcopal Conference of Türkiye) to check the terminology before launch.
- Serve the files with gzip or brotli. Most hosts do this automatically. With compression, the largest page (the Saints calendar) is about 140 KB. The deploy minifies the CSS and JS with esbuild (`npm install -g esbuild` to get the same result locally; without it the build falls back to a simpler minifier).
